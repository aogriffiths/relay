Long versions includes examples and useful extracts from the PubSubHubbub
specification. Short versions omit these and other non-normative information.
If you are implementing Relay or would find background and examples useful read
the long versions. If you are only looking for the normative parts of the
specifications or to see how simple they are read the short versions.
