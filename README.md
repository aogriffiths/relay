This repository holds the latest Relay spefications, which are published in a number of ways.

Long versions includes examples and useful extracts from the PubSubHubbub
specification. Short versions omit these and other non-normative information.

The Published versions are official approved releases of the specification. The Editor's Draft
is the latest _work in progress_ version.

If you are implementing Relay or would find background and examples useful read
the long versions. If you are only looking for the normative parts of the
specifications or to see how simple the specification really is, read the short versions.
